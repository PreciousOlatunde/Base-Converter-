# Base-Converter-
This program runs as a special type of calculator that allows for conversions between the main number bases (binary, decimal, octal and hexadecimal) all in one place.

The program displays a menu from which you can select what base the number you want to convert is currently in by entering either '1' for Binary (Base 2), '2' for Octal (Base 8), '3' for Decimal (Base 10), '4' for Hexadecimal (Base 16) or '0' to quit the program. 
After selecting a base, enter the number you wish to convert, in the format you specified. 
The program then prints the number coverted to all the other number bases.
